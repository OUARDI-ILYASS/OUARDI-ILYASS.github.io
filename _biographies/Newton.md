Sir Isaac Newton was a great mathematician

“One of the greatest intellectual legacies of the seventeenth cen­tury, calculus was developed first by Newton in his creative years of 1665 and 1666,when he was a young Cambridge University student on retreat in his country estate.” ([Bardi, 2007, p. v](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=4&annotation=3DCGWANB))

“What emerged from these years is perhaps the greatest single body of knowledge any scientist has ever produced in such a short period.” ([Bardi, 2007, p. v](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=4&annotation=29DFQF96))

“Newton had invented calculus, which he called his method of fluxions and fluents” ([Bardi, 2007, p. v](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=4&annotation=IWRLBWE8))

“he kept this work a closely held secret for most of his life” ([Bardi, 2007, p. v](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=4&annotation=ZVWQ777C))


“The book described Newton's experiments and conclusions about the basic physical behavior of light and optics derived through” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=8&annotation=QM3AX7ML))

“years of independent experimentation” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=9&annotation=2ZJLIENW))

“that hght was composed of emissions of particles and that white light was a mixture of different rays of distinct colors.” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=9&annotation=8U6JHNZ4))

“Opticks had a huge impact, and it was well received at home and abroad.” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=9&annotation=NHP9TZUC))

“It was written in the kind of clear language that only comes from an authoritative and comprehensive understanding of the subject-an understanding that Newton had cultivated over the course of a couple decades.” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=9&annotation=9MSYVH8J))

“A significant portion of this work was described in Newton's Principia, published in 1687” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=10&annotation=EMBULF9M))

“In 1704, Newton was no longer a professor at Cambridge and now lived in London, where he would spend the last thirty years of his life as a government administrator in charge of the British mint” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=10&annotation=Y4D8379T))

“Nevertheless,it was also a first of sorts because, in it, he staked his claim to the invention of calculus.” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=12&annotation=5QNXRQ9D))

“it had only a small section in the back on calculus, a treatise Newton had written a dozen years before, entitled Tractatus de Quadratura Curvarum (On the Quadrature of Curves)” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=12&annotation=YS2BX6I4))

“As strange as it may seem for a mathematician as famous as Newton, this appendix was his first actual publication of a purely mathematical treatise.” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=12&annotation=T4T3WZXY))

“For most of his life, the heart of his mathematical work was not published.” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=13&annotation=XVKEMUL9))

“It might seem strange compared to today's publication-enamored academic world that anyone would sit on an intellectual development as huge as calculus for a period of months, let alone years or decades” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=13&annotation=RNLS8XG3))

“Basically, calculus is a set of mathematical tools for analyzing these bodies in motion.” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=13&annotation=L5NSCFL7))

“Dijferentials are small momentary increments or decreases in changing quantities” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=13&annotation=KMG86CRZ))

“integrals are sums of infinitesimal intervals of geometrical curves or shapes” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=13&annotation=7D8N7VYU))

“But Newton was the first to figure out a general system that enabled him to analyze these sorts of problems generally­ calculus or, as Newton called it, the method of fluxions and fluents.” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=16&annotation=6DBTIXSN))



“Newton had suffered in quiet humiliation for years with the knowledge that he was first inventor of calculus, and he was a smoldering fire ready to be released into flames” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=17&annotation=9XZ7IHTB))

“This was an interesting time in history, and the times in which the two had lived played a major role in the dispute that would eventually break out between them.” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=18&annotation=G6T77I83))

“As Louis XIV famously said, "L'etat, c'est moi "-1 am the state.” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=19&annotation=9KKB7I5U))

“the seventeenth century also saw some of the greatest scientific and mathematical advances made by some of the grea” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=19&annotation=2YXUHYMB))

“est minds who ever lived” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=19&annotation=DH4JW6GW))

“The nature of light and sound were discovered.The diameter of the Earth was estimated to within a few yards, and the speed of light was measured accurately. The orbits of planets and comets were tracked by telescopes and moons were discovered around Saturn and Jupiter.” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=19&annotation=D8LYVC8P))

“The circulation of blood through the body was carefully charted, and microscopes led to the discovery of cells and a world of tiny organisms too small to be seen with the naked eye” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=19&annotation=7B7ZUC3Z))
