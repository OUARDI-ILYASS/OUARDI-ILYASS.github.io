His parents were Friedrich Leibniz and Catharina Schmuck, both moral and well-educated individuals.


“Leibniz came upon calculus ten years later, during the prolific time he spent in Paris around 1675. Over the next ten years,he refined his discovery and developed a completely original system of symbols and notations.” ([Bardi, 2007, p. vi](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=5&annotation=TWTK3VSI))

“With these two papers,Leibniz was able to claim intellectual ownership for his original invention of calculus.And calculus was such a promising invention that, by the year 1700, Leibniz would be regarded by many in Europe as one of the greatest mathematicians alive.” ([Bardi, 2007, p. vi](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=5&annotation=PNQFR4UB))

“invented calculus independently, and more important, he was the first to publish his ideas, developed calculus more than Newton, had far superior notation (one still used to this day), and worked for years to move calculus forward into a mathematical framework that others could use as well.” ([Bardi, 2007, p. viii](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=7&annotation=LQET79ZI))


“Leibniz discovered calculus during the prolific time he spent in Paris between 1672 and 1676.” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=16&annotation=MT5CUI9P))

“And since Leibniz believed in simple explanations rather than jargon, he invented a completely original and ingenious system of notation to go along with it.” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=16&annotation=L8PEWGJA))

“then published his results in two scholarly papers that appeared in 1684 and 1686” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=16&annotation=LNWTPYGI))

“The word calculus was even coined by Leibniz” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=16&annotation=WF2CISXQ))

“The one place where Leibniz's mathematJ.cs had not yet caught on was in England. Part of the problem, apparently, was that the English lackedinterest in foreignjournals” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=16&annotation=NZ6A77ZQ))

“He was born during one ofthe most horrible chapters in the history of Europe: the Thirty Years' War” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=22&annotation=C2M4X4VV))

“What mattered was that Germany had been utterly shattered by it.” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=22&annotation=68LY5NUR))

“Sweden's army that, in 1633, the army's expenses cost a fraction of what it had in 1630.” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=23&annotation=VEZGICDQ))

“When Leibniz was born in 1646, the war was almost over” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=23&annotation=4NTHSH5A))

“He was born in Leipzig, which had been in the heart ofthe war.” ([Bardi, 2007, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/QU4SUXGG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/942P6QRA?page=23&annotation=4AXN3D5N))
