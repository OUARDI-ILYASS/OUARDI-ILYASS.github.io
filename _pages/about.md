### Hello, my name is Ilyass Ouardi.

I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Milan, driven by a passion for blending technology, math, and a touch of social good. My journey into the world of problem-solving began with high school coding and math competitions, and that spark has only grown since. From developing tools to assist non-profits to diving into the depths of machine learning, I’m always on the lookout for ways to push the boundaries of what tech can do.

Research is where my heart lies, and I'm particularly fascinated by machine learning, theoretical computer science, and software engineering. My goal is to contribute to cutting-edge advancements and pursue a PhD in the United States.

When I’m not buried in code or research papers, I’m on the field—whether it’s playing football or shooting hoops. I’ve also dabbled in modeling in Milan, where I’ve met some amazing people and broadened my perspective.

Thanks for stopping by!
