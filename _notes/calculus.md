## Introduction

Calculus is one of the most powerful and fundamental branches of mathematics, dealing with change and motion. At its core, calculus is the study of how things change, enabling us to understand the rates at which quantities increase or decrease and to calculate the total accumulation of quantities. It is divided into two main areas: **differential calculus** and **integral calculus**. Differential calculus focuses on rates of change, such as the slope of a curve or the velocity of an object, while integral calculus deals with accumulation, like finding the area under a curve or the total distance traveled.

### A Brief History: The Calculus Controversy

The development of calculus is attributed to two of the greatest mathematicians in history: Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Both independently developed the fundamental principles of calculus in the late 17th century, though their approaches and notations differed significantly. Newton, working primarily in England, developed calculus to solve problems related to motion and gravitation. He called his method "the method of fluxions," focusing on the concept of instantaneous rates of change.

Meanwhile, Leibniz, working in continental Europe, developed a more formalized system with a different notation, which is the one we predominantly use today. His work on the infinitesimal calculus provided a more rigorous foundation for the subject, focusing on the sum of infinitely small quantities.

This simultaneous development led to a bitter dispute over the invention of calculus, often referred to as the "Calculus Controversy" or the "War of Calculus." Newton's followers accused Leibniz of plagiarism, while Leibniz's supporters claimed the opposite. Despite the controversy, both Newton and Leibniz's contributions were monumental, and modern calculus is a synthesis of their ideas.

Today, calculus is essential in a wide range of fields, from physics and engineering to economics and biology. It provides the mathematical tools needed to model and analyze systems that change continuously, making it a cornerstone of modern science and technology.

In this course, we will embark on a journey through the fundamental concepts of calculus like to limits, derivatives, and integrals. By the end, we'll have a solid understanding of how calculus can be used to solve real-world problems and model continuous change.
Let's dive in!
